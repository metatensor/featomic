If you are interested in another programming language we\nrecommend you first follow this tutorial and afterward take a look at the how-to guide\non `userdoc-how-to-computing-soap`.\n\n## The dataset\n\nThe atomic configurations used in our documentation are a small subset of the [ShiftML2\ndataset](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c03854) containing molecular\ncrystals. There are four crystals - one with each of the elements ``[H, C]``, ``[H, C,\nN, O]``, ``[H, C, N]``, and ``[H, C, O]``. For each crystal, we have 10 structures: the\nfirst one is geometry-optimized. The following 9 contain atoms that are slightly\ndisplaced from the geometry-optimized one. You can obtain the dataset from our\n:download:`website <../../static/dataset.xyz>`.\n"
